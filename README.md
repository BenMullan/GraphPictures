# GraphPictures!

_A suite of tools for plotting raster images as vector graphics on different sorts of Graphs (Desmos, Excel, or Oscilloscopes)_

### To use this software:
- Install Visual Studio (2010 or never)
- Download [the latest `.zip` of this repository](https://github.com/BenMullan/GraphPictures/archive/refs/heads/main.zip)
- Extract the zip's contents, and double-click the `GraphPictures.sln` solution
- Press the green "play" (Debug) button at the top, to start `GraphPicturesWebParts`

(To plot excel-based graphs and generate desmos-pastable bezier expressions, start the `GraphPicturesWindowsUtils` project instead)

I wrote this software back in the 1st year of sixth-form, using VS 2010 on a 12-year-old Latitude E5500 running Windows 7.
It was an amazingly fun project, which made quite a large splash, and even helped me to get my first IT job!
Looking back at the code, one does chuckle at conventions one has since outgrown, and identify severe bodges (that I thought admissable programming techniques at the time 🤣).
Neverthenonetheless, as of 2024, it all still seems to run just fine in the latest version of VS & Windows. Happy graphing!

(Note: This version of the solution does not include the oscilloscope-graphing resources.)
